Description: indicator showing session management, status and user switching
 This indicator is designed to be placed on the right side of a panel and
 give the user easy control for changing their instant message status.  
 Switching to another user.  Starting a guest session.  Or controlling the
 status of their own session.
 .
 It requires some way to be hosted into a panel.  For the GNOME Panel the
 appropriate package is indicator-applet-session.
